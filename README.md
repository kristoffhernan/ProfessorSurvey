https://friendly-borg-18530c.netlify.app/index.html

Population

Sampling Frame
: A list of email addresses of current professors and lecturers taken from the [UCR Profiles](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home) website

Sampling Unit

##### A few possible sources of selection bias
1. Nonresponse: We dont know how many instructors will respond to the survey
2. Some professors might not teach anymore
3. Some professors will not open up the email unless it includes the course name they are teaching in the subject header
4. Unsure if the professors will be 100% truthful with their answers
5. Unsure if the instructors will speed through the survey without giving it a thought, just to complete it
6. Instructors that receive a lot of emails may miss the survey request
